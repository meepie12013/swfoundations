Here's an example:\n","\n","```\n","...\n","\n","if(myGrade > 90):\n","\n","  print(\"You're an honor student, yay!\")\n","\n","  if(myGrade > 94):\n","    print(\"You're also a president's list student!\")\n","\n","    if(myGrade > 98):\n","      print(\"And you qualify for valedictorian!!!!\")\n","      speech = input(\"Please type the first line of your speech here: \")\n","      \n","      if(len(speech) > 100):\n","        print(\"Your speech is too long.\")\n","    \n","    print(\"Make sure to wear the included ribbon to signify this great honor\")\n","\n","...\n","```\n","\n","As you can see, we nest `if` statements four levels deep. Going down is usually not that hard to follow along, but coming back up can be confusing. For example, what is the _minimum_ requirement to receive the message about \"wearing the included ribbon\" in the last `print` statement?\n","\n","It happens if you're at minimum a president's list student, inside the second `if` statement. What if there were even more `if` statements after it, taking us back down yet again?\n","\n","It's very important to keep track of where you are in code, and ensure that you're using the proper level of indentation for each action you want your program to take.\n","\n","Leaving comments can help make this clearer to you, and the other readers of your code. Iterative testing helps you catch mistakes with indentation before they go too far as well."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YhDbPKRL_0Y3","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Scoping things out\n","\n","`if` statements are the first of many building blocks that require you to use indentation to separate out conditional code. With them, we need to talk about something known as **scope**.\n","\n","When we talk about scope, we're talking about accessibility and variables.\n","Up until now, there is only one rule about programming you've understood - code is read by Python from _top to bottom_.\n","\n","Now that we've introduced `if` statements, the flow of our program is _conditional_. In other words, certain parts of the code may never run.\n","\n","We haven't talked about it, but what do you think happens when you _create_ a variable **inside** of an `if` statement? You can use it right away, of course. But if it's in conditional code, it may never run. And if it doesn't, what if you try to use it afterwords? **It won't work**.\n","\n","That makes perfect sense, right? If the variable hasn't been created, of course there's nothing to access. If we tried to access a variable that we never created _anywhere_ in our code it wouldn't work either.\n","\n","This is what scope is. If a variable is created inside of a statement, it can be used _at_ it's level of indentation, and all indentation layers _deeper_ than it. It **cannot** be accessed at indentation layers _shallower_ than it.\n","\n","Let's use some examples to understand this concept."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lThzg1MY5a0C","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This code is okay, because the variable will always be created before we use it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WzcUhLeQ5ghH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["myName = \"Phil\"\n","print(myName)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PaVgLe0X5j2X","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This code is _not_ okay, because the variable is _never created_ before we use it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1-a7_jeE5tMt","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["print(favoriteAnimal)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XHyZsoMI51i-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This code is okay, because the variable will always be created before we use it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"K-a_NLay54m8","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["favoriteColor = \"Red\"\n","\n","if(favoriteColor != \"Green\"):\n","  print(favoriteColor, \"is a great color!\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7CK_Ikco6GuD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This code is _not_ okay, because the variable `favoritePetName` is _not always created_ before we use it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YonQFg956LwE","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["favoritePet = input(\"Please enter your favorite kind of pet: \")\n","if(favoritePet != \"Cat\"):\n","  print(\"I had a\", favoritePet, \"too!\")\n","  favoritePetName = input(\"What was the name of yours? \")\n","print(favoritePetName,\"is a great name!\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OwmWVMnd7WID","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Warning: Google Colab (and Jupyter Notebook as a whole) makes it a little difficult to test scope.
