Text is _always_ a string.\n","\n","However, we may need to get a number from a user, like for this workshop. In that case, we're going to need to **explicitly convert** the data we receive from `input()` into a numeric format we can work with.\n","\n","Luckily, there's no tricks involved. All you need to do is wrap `int()` or `float()` around your variable or your call to `input()`. \n","\n","Here's an example you can try yourself:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"luHwGIdUVfFp","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["myAge = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n","myAge = int(myAge)\n","myFutureAge = myAge + 10\n","print(\"In ten years, you'll be\", myFutureAge, \"years old!\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AaR3snzl2qlp","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Best Practices\n","\n","Understanding how variables work and what they are is most important, but it's always good to try and write the cleanest and easiest to read code that you can, so let's talk about some of the best habits you can establish to use variables painlessly!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kRh9KXZK3Chs","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Consistent Naming Conventions\n","\n","In lecture, we discussed that variables can be named anything, so long as they aren't one of Python's reserved words. We also discussed how many programmers use camel-case or snake-case to keep their variable names clean and easy to read.\n","\n","A good habit to get into now is to choose one of these two conventions and use it exclusively when writing code. It would look jarring to see both conventions used in one program, because people may be confused when remembering which convention is used for a given variable name.\n","\n","When working on programs where you are the only developer, it's fine to use either of these conventions, but when working on a project with other people, try to agree on a convention or use whichever is pre-existing for consistency."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VlzY2EBWKjqP","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Preventing \"Magic Numbers\"\n","\n","Let's say that you're trying to write a program that determines the sales tax of a given product. You enter the price of a product, and it becomes multiplied by the amount plus sales tax.\n","\n","For example, the sales tax in Maryland is 6%. So, you could have code that looks like this:\n","\n","```\n","finalPrice = productPrice * 1.06\n","```\n","\n","Multiplying a price by 1.06 means that you are getting 106% of that price. You might have many, many lines of code that use that 1.06, since that is the \"magic number\" in this situation.\n","\n","Suppose you want to reuse this program for different states. Each state has a different sales tax. In theory, it would be very simple to reuse this program - just replace 1.06 with the correct multiplier for that particular state - but what if your program was a couple hundred lines long? You might have to change a lot of code.\n","\n","What if you forget to change one of the 1.06's? Your program won't work correctly, and it might take a minute to see why. Or what if 1.06 is used for other things around your program, and changing one of _those_ 1.06's causes a problem?\n","\n","The solution to these \"magic numbers\" is to put them inside of a variable. That way, the number has **context** and is easily understood.\n","\n","If you needed to recycle the program at that point, you could simply change the value once, and it would update anywhere the variable is used in your code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PcLDaQH2QCz_","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Exercises"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9etj8LcvQds5","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.
