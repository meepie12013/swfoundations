In these scenarioes, the number of times the loop runs doesn't have to be known by the programmer or hardcoded into the application. It can be based on user input, or the number of values in a sequence.\n","\n","On the other hand, `while` loops run an indeterminate number of times, since it will keep running until a special condition is met. Unlike a `for` loop, what happens in the loop body of a `while` loop can affect the number of times it runs.\n","\n","We've also talked about how you could use a `while` loop to solve any loop problem, but for this exercise, you must use the **appropriate loop** to solve the problem.\n","\n","Let's look at some scenarios to learn more about appropriate loop usage."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oMw1q2z_ju1G","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Input Validation\n","\n","`input()` is a powerful function, but you can't restrict the possibilities that the user can type in. This function will return any value that could be a legal `string` in Python.\n","\n","But lets say that we want to get a number from the user. If they type in 'egg', that is as valid of a string as '2' or '30'. If we try to cast is using `int()`, we're going to be in a lot of trouble.\n","\n","While we normally could write `int(input(\"Prompt: \"))`, we could break this into parts. If we put the `input()` inside of a loop body, and the `int()` cast outside of the loop, we could use a loop condition to ensure that the returned string is made up of only digits.\n","\n","So what kind of loop does this sound like?

In this case, the number of iterations that will run is entirely based on the number of items in these sequences.\n","\n","While both types of loops do the same general thing over and over, the goal of `for` loops in this type of scenario is usually to do something to each item of a sequence."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZNyuWku0dg8N","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Waiting with While\n","\n","There are also times where we want to wait for something.
